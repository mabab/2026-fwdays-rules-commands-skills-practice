description: "Final tightening pass for slides.md: clarity, brevity, consistency, and time-budget fit (35–45 min)."

# /final-polish

Perform a **final polish** pass on `slides.md` before presenting the workshop.

## Read first

- `slides.md`
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `.cursor/rules/slidev.md` and `.cursor/rules/project-specific.md`

## Goals (must achieve)

- **Clarity**: each slide has a single purpose and a crisp takeaway
- **Brevity**: fewer words, more signal; move details to speaker notes
- **Consistency**:
  - stable terminology (“rules” vs “skills”)
  - consistent language and tone across the deck
- **Time fit**: 35–45 minutes total; flag any over-stuffed sections
- **Practicality**: examples and exercises are present and placed well

## Constraints

- Do not introduce new requirements.
- Avoid custom Vue components and new dependencies.
- Prefer small, targeted edits over rewrites.

## Output format (must follow)

### Top improvements (P0)
- 3–8 bullets: the highest impact changes to make now.

### Suggested edits
For each edit include:
- **Where**: slide title(s)
- **Change**: what to change (concise)
- **Reason**: 1 sentence

### Time budget recap
- Section-level timing estimate + total.

### Final checklist
- Bullet list suitable for a pre-talk run-through.
