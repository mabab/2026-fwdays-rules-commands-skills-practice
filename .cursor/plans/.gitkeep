# Cursor IDE Plans Directory

This directory is for storing Cursor IDE plan files that should be tracked in version control.

Note: Cursor IDE may also store plans in the user's home directory (~/.cursor/plans/), 
but plans stored here in the project will be version controlled and shared with the team.
